# OOP_CALCULATOR

Four fundamental mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—are available for the user to choose from in the software. The user interface is made to ask them to enter two numbers and choose an operation. The outcome is then computed by the software and shown. 

# Code Steps

1.The user will be asked to one of the four operations.

2.After the operation, the user will be asked to enter two numbers.

3.The application will verify the inputs and solve any possible exceptions.

4.Show the result.

5.The program will ask if the user wants to do another calculations.

6.If yes, go back to the start.

7.If no, show "Thank you for your hardwork."

# Reminder

Before executing the application, make sure you have Python installed on your system.
